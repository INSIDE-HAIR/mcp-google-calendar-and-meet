# Google Meet MCP Server

[![smithery badge](https://smithery.ai/badge/@cool-man-vk/google-meet-mcp-server)](https://smithery.ai/server/@cool-man-vk/google-meet-mcp-server)

A Model Context Protocol (MCP) server for interacting with Google Meet through the Google Calendar API and Google Meet API. This server provides comprehensive tools for creating, managing, and configuring Google Meet meetings programmatically, including support for recording capabilities.

## Description

This project implements an MCP server that allows AI agents to interact with Google Meet by creating, retrieving, and managing meetings through the Google Calendar API and Google Meet API. It leverages the MCP (Model Context Protocol) specification to expose these capabilities as tools that can be used by compatible AI systems like Claude Desktop.

## Installation

### Installing via Smithery

To install Google Meet MCP Server for Claude Desktop automatically via [Smithery](https://smithery.ai/server/@cool-man-vk/google-meet-mcp-server):

```bash
npx -y @smithery/cli install @cool-man-vk/google-meet-mcp-server --client claude
```

### Manual Installation
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/INSIDE-HAIR/mcp-google-meet.git

# Navigate to the project directory
cd mcp-google-meet

# Install dependencies
npm install
```

## Setup

Before using the Google Meet MCP server, you need to set up your Google API credentials:

1. Visit the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
2. Create a new project or select an existing one
3. Enable the following APIs:
   - Google Calendar API
   - Google Meet API (for recording features)
4. Create OAuth 2.0 credentials (Desktop application)
5. Download the credentials JSON file
6. Set the environment variables with the paths to your credentials:
   ```bash
   export GOOGLE_MEET_CREDENTIALS_PATH="/path/to/your/credentials.json"
   export GOOGLE_MEET_TOKEN_PATH="./token.json"
   ```
7. Run the setup script to authenticate and generate the token:
   ```bash
   npm run setup
   ```

This will open a browser window where you can authorize the application to access your Google Calendar and Meet APIs.

## Usage

Once setup is complete, you can start the MCP server:

```bash
npm run start
```

The server will run and expose the following tools:
