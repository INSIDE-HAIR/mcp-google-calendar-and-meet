## üîß Technical Questions

### Q: Why are my tools not showing up in Claude Desktop?
**A:** Check these common issues:
1. **MCP Server Status**: Ensure the server is running without errors
2. **Claude Desktop Configuration**: Verify claude_desktop_config.json is correct
3. **Authentication**: Confirm OAuth setup completed successfully
4. **Restart Required**: Restart Claude Desktop after configuration changes
5. **Path Issues**: Use absolute paths in configuration files

### Q: How do I troubleshoot authentication errors?
**A:**
1. **Check Credentials**: Verify credentials.json exists and has correct permissions (600)
2. **API Enablement**: Ensure Calendar API and Meet API are enabled in Google Cloud Console
3. **OAuth Consent**: Verify OAuth consent screen is properly configured
4. **Token Refresh**: Delete existing token files and re-run `npm run setup`
5. **Scopes**: Confirm all required OAuth scopes are included

### Q: What's the difference between the two entry points?
**A:**
- **`src/index.ts`**: Standard MCP server for direct deployment, includes full monitoring
- **`src/smithery.ts`**: Smithery-compatible stateless server for platform deployment
- Both provide identical functionality, just different initialization methods

### Q: How do I enable monitoring and health checks?
**A:**
```bash
# Enable health check endpoint
export ENABLE_HEALTH_CHECK=true
export HEALTH_CHECK_PORT=9090

# Start server
npm run start

# Test endpoints
curl http://localhost:9090/health
curl http://localhost:9090/metrics
```

### Q: Can I use this with other AI platforms besides Claude?
**A:** The server implements the Model Context Protocol (MCP) standard, so it should work with any MCP-compatible AI platform. However, it's specifically optimized for Claude Desktop integration.

## üé• Google Meet Specific Questions

### Q: Why can't I create recordings?
**A:** Common issues:
- **Workspace License**: Recording requires Google Workspace Business Standard+
- **Manual Activation**: API only prepares recording - you must manually start during meeting
- **Permissions**: Ensure user has recording permissions in Workspace admin
- **Meeting Type**: Some meeting types may restrict recording

### Q: What's the difference between access types?
**A:**
- **OPEN**: Anyone with link can join (no Google account required)
- **TRUSTED**: Requires Google account to join (default, recommended)
- **RESTRICTED**: Only invited participants can join

### Q: How do transcripts work?
**A:**
- Transcripts generate automatically for meetings with transcription enabled
- Available 24-48 hours after meeting ends
- Includes timestamps and participant identification
- Smart notes (AI summaries) require Gemini license

### Q: Can I get participant data from meetings?
**A:** Yes, using conference records you can access:
- Participant names and join/leave times
- Session information (multiple sessions if participant rejoined)
- Overall attendance duration
- Meeting engagement metrics

## üìÖ Calendar Integration Questions

### Q: Can I create recurring meetings?
**A:** Yes, use the `calendar_v3_create_event` tool with appropriate recurrence rules. The API supports complex recurrence patterns including daily, weekly, monthly, and custom patterns.

### Q: How do I check if someone is available?
**A:** Use the `calendar_v3_freebusy_query` tool to check availability across multiple calendars for a specific time range.

### Q: Can I create events in other people's calendars?
**A:** Only if you have write access to their calendar. The tool respects Google Calendar permissions - you can only create events in calendars where you have appropriate access.

### Q: What timezone handling is supported?
**A:** Full timezone support using IANA timezone identifiers (e.g., "America/New_York"). Times are converted appropriately for all participants based on their timezone settings.

## üîê Security and Privacy

### Q: How is my data protected?
**A:**
- **OAuth 2.0**: Industry-standard authentication
- **Individual Credentials**: Each user has separate credentials
- **No Data Storage**: Server doesn't store your calendar or meeting data
- **Token Encryption**: Refresh tokens handled securely
- **HTTPS Only**: All Google API communication encrypted

### Q: Can other team members see my credentials?
**A:** No. Each user must create and use their own individual Google OAuth credentials. The architecture prevents credential sharing for security.

### Q: What data does the server access?
**A:** Only what you explicitly grant through OAuth scopes:
- Calendar events and metadata
- Meet spaces you create or have access to
- Conference records for meetings you attended
- No personal files, emails, or other Google services

### Q: How do I revoke access?
**A:**
1. Go to [Google Account permissions](https://myaccount.google.com/permissions)
2. Find your MCP Server application
3. Click "Remove Access"
4. Delete local credentials and token files

---

## üö® Troubleshooting

### Q: Server won't start - what should I check?
**A:**
1. **Node.js Version**: Ensure Node.js 18+ is installed
2. **Dependencies**: Run `npm install` to ensure all packages are installed
3. **Credentials Path**: Verify credential file paths are correct and absolute
4. **File Permissions**: Check credentials have 600 permissions
5. **Port Conflicts**: Ensure no other process is using required ports

### Q: Getting "Module not found" errors?
**A:**
```bash
# Clean install dependencies
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
npm install

# Verify TypeScript compilation
npm run build

# Check Node.js version
node --version  # Should be 18+
```

### Q: "Permission denied" errors when accessing Google APIs?
**A:**
1. **Check OAuth Scopes**: Ensure all required scopes are included in OAuth consent screen
2. **API Enablement**: Verify Calendar API and Meet API are enabled
3. **Account Type**: Some features require Google Workspace (not personal Gmail)
4. **Admin Permissions**: Some Meet features require Workspace admin approval

### Q: High memory usage or performance issues?
**A:**
- **Check Resource Limits**: Monitor using `curl http://localhost:9090/system`
- **Review Logs**: Look for memory leaks or excessive API calls
- **Optimize Configuration**: Disable debug logging in production
- **Update Dependencies**: Ensure latest versions for performance fixes
