## ðŸ’¡ Pro Tips for Using Templates

1. **Save Successful Variations** - Keep a personal note of templates that work well for your use cases
2. **Team Standardization** - Share effective templates with your team for consistency
3. **Incremental Improvements** - Refine templates based on what Claude suggests or what works better

### **Context-Aware Usage**
1. **Morning Planning**: Use weekly/daily view templates
2. **Active Scheduling**: Use creation and update templates  
3. **End of Week**: Use analytics and review templates
4. **Project Planning**: Use complex multi-step templates

### **Efficiency Patterns**
1. **Batch Similar Operations** - "Create 5 one-on-one meetings with my team for next week"
2. **Set Defaults** - "All my team meetings should include Google Meet and be 30 minutes by default"
3. **Use Natural Follow-ups** - After creating a meeting, ask "Should I invite anyone else?" or "Set up any follow-up meetings?"
