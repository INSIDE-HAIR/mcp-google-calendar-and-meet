  ✅ "Conference room hardware setup requires admin access. Please contact IT or visit admin.google.com > Devices > Meet hardware"
  
  ✅ "This feature requires Google Workspace Admin permissions. I'll help with what I can access, but for the full setup, please contact your administrator"

Avoid:
  ❌ "I can't do that"
  ❌ "That's not supported"
  ❌ "Use Google instead"
```

#### **Helpful Context**
```yaml
Include in Escalation:
  - Specific URL or location in Google UI
  - Required permission level
  - Alternative approaches if available
  - What the MCP can help with as follow-up
```

### **Training Users on Escalation**

#### **Setting Expectations**
```yaml
Educate Users About:
  - What MCP excels at vs. Google UI strengths
  - When to try MCP first vs. go directly to Google
  - How to recognize escalation situations
  - Who to contact for different types of issues
```

#### **Building Confidence**
```yaml
Help Users Understand:
  - MCP and Google UI are complementary, not competing
  - Escalation is normal and expected for certain tasks
  - Using the right tool for each task improves efficiency
  - Both approaches maintain the same security and compliance
```
