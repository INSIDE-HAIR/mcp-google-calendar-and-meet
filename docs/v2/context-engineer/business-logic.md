## üîß Implementation Patterns

### **1. User Experience Patterns**

#### **Natural Language Processing**
```typescript
// Good: Natural business language
"Schedule our quarterly board meeting for next month with all board members"

// Implementation considerations:
- Map "board members" to specific email list
- Apply "quarterly board meeting" template
- Set appropriate security and recording settings
- Include standard agenda and materials
```

#### **Context-Aware Automation**
```typescript
// Pattern: Smart defaults based on meeting type
Meeting Type: "Client Call"
‚Üí Auto-apply: External participant security
‚Üí Auto-enable: Recording for compliance
‚Üí Auto-invite: Account manager + solution engineer
‚Üí Auto-set: 60-minute duration with 15-min buffer
```

### **2. Permission & Security Patterns**

#### **Role-Based Access Control**
```yaml
Executive Level:
  ‚úÖ Create restricted access meetings
  ‚úÖ Access all company meeting analytics
  ‚úÖ Override security policies when needed
  ‚ùå Cannot: Bypass audit logging

Manager Level:
  ‚úÖ Create team meetings with recording
  ‚úÖ Access team meeting analytics
  ‚úÖ Manage team calendar permissions
  ‚ùå Cannot: Access other team's sensitive meetings

Individual Contributor:
  ‚úÖ Create personal meetings
  ‚úÖ Schedule team meetings they're invited to
  ‚úÖ Access their own meeting history
  ‚ùå Cannot: Create company-wide meetings
```

#### **Data Classification Handling**
```yaml
Public Meetings:
  - Open access type allowed
  - Recording optional
  - Transcripts can be shared
  - External participants welcome

Internal Meetings:
  - Trusted access type required
  - Recording recommended
  - Transcripts internal-only
  - External participants need approval

Confidential Meetings:
  - Restricted access only
  - Recording mandatory
  - Transcripts secured storage
  - No external participants
  - Waiting room required
```

### **3. Workflow Integration Patterns**

#### **CRM Integration Logic**
```yaml
Trigger: "Create client meeting"
Workflow:
  1. Check CRM for client contact information
  2. Auto-populate attendees from account team
  3. Set meeting classification based on deal stage
  4. Apply appropriate security settings
  5. Update CRM with meeting details
  6. Set follow-up reminders in CRM
```

#### **Project Management Integration**
```yaml
Trigger: "Schedule sprint planning"
Workflow:
  1. Pull team roster from project management tool
  2. Check previous sprint artifacts for context
  3. Create meeting with standard agenda template
  4. Set recording for retrospective analysis
  5. Create follow-up tasks in project tool
  6. Schedule related ceremonies automatically
```
